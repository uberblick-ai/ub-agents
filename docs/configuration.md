# Configuration reference

`ub-agent.yaml` sits at the root of the repository the agents work on. Unknown keys are
errors; `ub-agent check` validates the file.

## Top level

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `repository` | GitHub `owner/name`. It must match the checkout's `origin`. |
| `agents` | The agents, by name. |
| `runtimes` | Adapters for agent CLIs other than `codex` and `claude`. |
| `limits` | Default clocks and retry limits for every agent. |
| `poll-seconds` | How often an idle loop checks GitHub (default 30). |
| `stop-labels` | Labels that park an item (default `[needs-human]`). |
| `operators` | Other GitHub accounts whose claims and outcomes this launcher trusts. Only the authenticated account is trusted by default. |
| `queue` | Priority ranking, dependency waits and an optional milestone gate (defaults to FIFO, waiting for blockers, with milestones ignored). |

## Queue

```yaml
queue:
  priority:
    labels: [priority:urgent, priority:high, priority:normal, priority:low]
    default: priority:normal
  milestones: gate
  dependencies: wait
```

`priority.labels` is a nonempty list of unique, nonempty label names, highest first.
An item with several configured labels takes the highest. An item with none takes
`priority.default`, which must be one of the configured labels. If `default` is
omitted, unlabeled items rank below every configured label. Without `priority`, all
items have equal priority. Unknown keys in `queue` or `priority` are errors.
The launcher reads priority labels and never changes them.

A PR's effective priority is the highest of its own configured priority and the
effective priority of the open local issues it closes. Closing keywords in its
body (such as `Closes #21`, `Fixes: owner/repo#21` or `Resolves` followed by a local
issue URL) identify those issues; each reference requires a keyword. Closed issues,
PR references and references to other repositories do not contribute. This PR
rule applies in both dependency modes: `ignore` disables issue dependency
inheritance, but PRs still inherit their closing issues' own configured priority.

`milestones` accepts only `gate` or `ignore` and defaults to `ignore`. In `gate`
mode, new issues wait for the oldest open milestone with open issues or PRs to
close or empty; PR work, recovery and draft checkpoint resumption remain eligible.
In `ignore` mode, planning and claiming do not read milestones. This repository
explicitly sets `gate`.

`dependencies` accepts only `wait` or `ignore` and defaults to `wait`, including
without a `queue` block. In `wait` mode, an issue cannot start preparation or
implementation while any GitHub blocked-by issue is open, including blockers
in other repositories. Closed blockers do not gate it. The gate is rechecked
before claiming. An open local issue inherits the highest effective priority
of its open local dependents, directly or transitively, without changing labels.
Cycles terminate and share the highest reachable priority. With `ignore`, links
affect neither eligibility nor priority, and dependency reads are skipped.
PR work, recovery, completion of started runs and draft checkpoint resumption
remain ungated. With milestone gating, a new issue must pass both gates.
A failed or unreadable dependency read stops selection visibly.

`ub-agent init` writes `queue: {milestones: ignore, dependencies: wait}`. Without a
`queue` block, priorities are unconfigured, milestones are ignored and dependency
waits apply.

Within each work class, priority is followed by item creation time and then item
number. See [selection order](coordination.md#selection-order) for eligibility and
PR precedence. `ub-agent status` and `status --json` use the same rank order and
show each item's effective priority (`none` in text, `null` in JSON when no label
or default applies). Waiting issues name the active milestone number and open
blockers, using `owner/repo#N` for external blockers. Inherited priority names its
origin, for example `priority:urgent (inherited from #21)`. JSON includes
`priority_inherited_from` (the source issue number, or `null`) and `open_blockers`
(a list of issue references). PRs name the issue they close, for example
`priority:urgent (from closed issue #21)`; that wording identifies a closing
reference to an issue that is still open. JSON records it as `priority_from_issue`
(the issue number, or `null`). An item's own priority wins ties; among equally
urgent inherited sources the lowest issue number is shown.

## Agents

Each agent has exactly one of `runtime` or `command`.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `trigger` | Label, or list of labels, that starts the agent. |
| `kind` | `issue`, `pr` or `either` (default). |
| `runtime` | `cli:model:effort`, or a list of alternatives tried in order. |
| `instructions` | The agent's task file. Required with `runtime`. |
| `command` | An argv list to run instead of an LLM session. |
| `different-runtime-from` | Another agent's name. This agent must run on a different CLI, provider and model from the one that produced the PR's current commit; a different effort doesn't count. |
| `worktree` | `true` runs in a private checkout: the PR's exact commit, a fresh issue branch, or its safely reusable draft checkpoint (see [coordination](coordination.md#draft-checkpoints)). |
| `cwd` | Directory to run in, relative to the repository root. |
| `runtime-args` | Extra arguments for the runtime CLI, such as permission flags. |
| Limit keys | Override `limits` for this agent. |

## Limits

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `lease-minutes` | 60 | How long a claim lasts without renewal. |
| `renewal-minutes` | 5 | How often the launcher renews a running claim; less than half the lease. |
| `agent-timeout-minutes` | 180 | Deadline for one run. |
| `max-attempts` | 5 | Runs per item and agent before the item stops. |
| `retry-backoff-seconds` | 60 | First retry delay; it doubles with each attempt. |
| `max-backoff-seconds` | 3600 | Longest retry delay. |

## Built-in runtimes

The prompt, made of the assignment context and the agent's instructions, arrives on
stdin:

- `codex:MODEL:EFFORT` runs `codex exec --model MODEL --config model_reasoning_effort="EFFORT"`.
- `claude:MODEL:EFFORT` runs `claude --print --model MODEL --effort EFFORT`.

`runtime-args` are appended. They cannot change the model, the effort, or start from
an earlier session.

### Runtime permissions

The launcher adds no permission flags, so the CLIs start in their default headless
modes and usually cannot edit files or push. Grant each role what it needs:

```yaml
runtime-args: [--sandbox, danger-full-access]    # codex
runtime-args: [--permission-mode, acceptEdits, --permission-prompts, none,
               --allowedTools, "Bash(git *)", "Bash(gh *)", "Bash(ub-agent *)"]  # claude
```

`runtime-args` apply to every alternative in a runtime list, so use CLI-specific flags
only on agents with a single runtime. Codex's `workspace-write` sandbox cannot commit in
private worktrees, whose Git metadata lives in the main checkout.

## Other agent CLIs

```yaml
runtimes:
  example:
    provider: example-provider
    command: [example-cli, --model, "{model}", --effort, "{effort}"]
    check: [example-cli, auth, status]   # optional; doctor runs it
```

An agent then uses `runtime: "example:your-model:high"`. Only `{model}` and `{effort}`
are substituted, and no shell is involved. Without `check`, doctor reports the
runtime's authentication as not checkable.

## Commands instead of agents

```yaml
agents:
  investigate:
    command: [./scripts/investigate-issue]
    kind: issue
    trigger: investigate
    agent-timeout-minutes: 20
```

The command records its result with `ub-agent report`. It receives these environment
variables, as do LLM runtimes:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `UB_AGENT_CONTEXT` | Path to a JSON file describing the assignment |
| `UB_AGENT_REPOSITORY` | `owner/name` |
| `UB_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT` | Issue or PR number |
| `UB_AGENT_RUN` | Run id |
| `UB_AGENT_LEASE_ID` | The claim's comment id |
| `UB_AGENT_CANDIDATE_SHA` | The PR's head commit or resumed draft checkpoint; empty for fresh issue work |
| `UB_AGENT_BRANCH` | The branch to work on, when known |
| `UB_AGENT_PR` | PR number for a PR assignment or resumed issue draft; empty otherwise |
| `UB_AGENT_OPERATORS` | Trusted accounts, for `report` |

## Commands

- `ub-agent init [--repository owner/name] [--runtime cli:model:effort]` writes the
  starter `ub-agent.yaml` and `.agents/` files and adds `.ub-agent/` to `.gitignore`.
  It stops without writing anything if a starter file already exists.
- `ub-agent check` validates the configuration and instruction files.
- `ub-agent doctor [--json]` checks everything `check` does, plus Python, the platform,
  `git`, `gh`, GitHub access, runtimes and local state. It exits 1 when a required
  check fails; warnings and skips exit 0. The JSON has `version`, `ok` and `checks`,
  and each check has `id`, `status`, `required`, `agent`, `runtime`, `message` and
  `remedy`.
- `ub-agent launch [--once]` runs the loop in the foreground.
- `ub-agent status [--json]` shows matching work, claims, attempts and outcomes.
- `ub-agent report --status success|retry|blocked --summary TEXT [--handoff PR]`
  records the current run's outcome. It works only inside a supervised run.
- `ub-agent retry --number N --agent NAME --reason TEXT` resets one agent's attempts on
  an item once you have fixed the cause.
- `--config PATH` selects a different configuration file.
